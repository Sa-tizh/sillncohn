        <h1>Assignment 4 “Synthesis & Evaluation”</h1>
        <h3>28-01-2020; Group 62: Sebas Fredrik & Steijn Lek</h3>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In general, our webpage is not fully understandable and accessible for everyone, for example also blind people. But we can say that we did a lot to improve the experience for the visually, mentally and/or physically impaired.  
            <br>Our webpage is build in such a way that it is very intuitive for the user to interact with, there is a clear and organized structure and all functionality is accessible with keyboard input.<br>Furthermore, the website uses different colors to indicate certain states, for example if a link or input field is visited or not. <br>It is also has a responsive layout which means the layout of the webpage is adapted to different screen sizes like for example a tablet or smartphone. 
            <br>On the way we did make a few mistakes, but in the end we made our accessibility reflect our current knowledge and skill level, which we think is pretty good.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Accessibility Highlights</h2>
        <p>Due to our website being light on content, we had few WCAG guidelines that were important for us. This however also meant we could very easily narrow down the most relevant rules we had to follow for our webpage.
            <br>The first guideline that we wanted to report on is “”1.1 All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.” <br>This one we deemed very important for basically any websites, which is why it’s unfortunate that we did not fully commit to it. <br>We did put an alt text for our one picture in our html file, but we forgot to add it for our input form, which means visually impaired people would have a difficult time adding items to or resetting the database of products. <br>Furthermore images added in post using the web server do not get an alt text added to them. <br>Neither of these are too important, since not many people would want to add things to the database, and the relationship of the image in the table could determined from the column header, but either way there is room for improvement here.
            <br>The other guideline we deemed relevant is “2.1.1 All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.” <br>This one we followed completely. The entirety of the page can be navigated with the arrow keys, tab key and enter key. <br>No dexterity is needed of the user in terms of timings of keystrokes or speed of typing. <br>This rule we found most important and we had no issue implementing our website to conform to it. 
            </p>

            <td>No</td>
            <td>If the links were functional, one would be able to determine what the purpose of each link was, except for one link that is ambiguous to all users (“Learn more”). However, all links don’t link to anything, so their use cannot yet be accurately determined at all.</td>
